The TIGER/Line Files include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities).  An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population.  Places always nest within a State, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries.  An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions.  CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places.  CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the State in which they are located.  The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with State, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity.  CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary.  The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs for the 2010 Census is that they must contain some housing and population.  The boundaries of all 2010 Census incorporated places are as of January 1, 2010 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).  The boundaries of all 2010 Census CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The boundaries have been aligned to Miami-Dade County base data where they have been found to NOT be within +/- 10 ft

The process for creating the report card included five major steps, with the first being to conceptualize both the kinds of information most relevant to the health of Biscayne Bay and how that information should be conveyed by way of graphics, maps, tables, and narrative descriptions. Three major categories of Biscayne Bay health were identified by the County that together provide a representative evaluation of the bay’s ecosystem health: Water Quality, Habitat, and Fisheries. Second, indicators for water quality, habitat, and fisheries were selected. Third, thresholds were established for each indicator based on criteria in scientific literature and through analysis of the County’s historical record of data. This process included developing a baseline level of health for the bay that will be used for comparison, year to year. Threshold ranges were established for each parameter and a red, yellow, or green “stop-light” score was ascribed to the parameter. Fourth, the “stop-light” scores were calculated and assigned based on 2020 values for each parameter as measured against the baseline. Fifth, and lastly, the annual Biscayne Bay Report Card will be provided to the Commission, disseminated at County events and will be made available online.","Biscayne Bay Report Card 2021,Biscayne Bay Report,Florida,Miami-Dade County,MDC,County Government,Local Government,Production,Regulatory and Economic Resources,Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources,Miami-Dade County - Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources","Our quality of life is dependent on clean water that will support and sustain our community needs as well as our environment and economy.","/Categories/Production Content,/Categories/Source Department/Regulatory and Economic Resources","Miami-Dade County GIS Technical Support","Miami-Dade County provides this website as a public service to its residents and visitors.

Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads.  Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets.  However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area.  A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks.  As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas.  Census blocks cover all territory in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands).  Blocks are the smallest geographic areas for which the Census Bureau publishes data from the decennial census.  A block may consist of one or more faces.

In an attempt to preserve remaining forestlands in Miami-Dade County outside of Everglades National Park, and to provide property owners with an economic incentive to preserve forestland, the Miami-Dade County Commission adopted the Environmentally Endangered Lands Tax Covenant Ordinance in December 1979. The ordinance established significantly lower property tax assessments for outstanding forested sites, which are zoned for agriculture or residential usage. The Miami-Dade County Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER) Environmental Resources Management is responsible for administering the Environmentally Endangered Lands Tax Exemption Program. The rapid urbanization of Miami-Dade County has resulted in the virtual elimination of our once extensive pine and hammock forestlands. The Environmentally Endangered Lands Tax Exemption Program (EEL covenant program) creates temporarily protected areas where laws have not, sometimes in areas most vulnerable to development pressure. The EEL covenant program is codified by reference under Chapter 25B, Article II, of the Miami-Dade County Code as authorized by Section 193.501, Florida Statutes. Under the program, landowners enter into a ten-year conservation agreement with Miami-Dade County, where property owners agree to maintain a portion of their land in its natural condition in exchange for a tax reduction of 90% on the portion of the land set aside for conservation.

officers is sometimes necessary to accomplish their lawful duties, it is incumbent
upon the Department to review and document these incidents of force. Through this
process, concerns can be identified, and the Department can implement appropriate
action, such as training, discipline, and policy change when warranted.

Unauthorized Force Complaints are
identified by eight allegations: Criminal Misconduct (Battery), Criminal Misconduct
(Battery Domestic), Departmental Misconduct (Force Violation), Departmental Misconduct
(Force Violation Domestic), Minor Force (Injury), Minor Force (No Visible Injury),
Unauthorized Force (Injury), and Unauthorized Force (No Injury). Note: Historical data in this dashboard is available from January 1, 2018. Report locations are approximate.

Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads.  Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets.  However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area.  A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks.  As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas.  Census blocks cover all territory in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands).  Blocks are the smallest geographic areas for which the Census Bureau publishes data from the decennial census.  A block may consist of one or more faces.

The TIGER/Line Files include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities).  An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population.  Places always nest within a State, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries.  An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions.  CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places.  CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the State in which they are located.  The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with State, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity.  CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary.  The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs for the 2010 Census is that they must contain some housing and population.  The boundaries of all 2010 Census incorporated places are as of January 1, 2010 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).  The boundaries of all 2010 Census CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).

An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population.  Places always nest within a State, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries.  An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions.  CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places.  CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the State in which they are located.  The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with State, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity.  CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary.  The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs for the 2010 Census is that they must contain some housing and population.  The boundaries of all 2010 Census incorporated places are as of January 1, 2010 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).  The boundaries of all 2010 Census CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).

The TIGER/Line Files include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities).  An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population.  Places always nest within a State, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries.  An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions.  CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places.  CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the State in which they are located.  The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with State, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity.  CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary.  The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs for the 2010 Census is that they must contain some housing and population.  The boundaries of all 2010 Census incorporated places are as of January 1, 2010 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).  The boundaries of all 2010 Census CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The boundaries have been aligned to Miami-Dade County base data where they have been found to NOT be within +/- 10 ft

The process for creating the report card included five major steps, with the first being to conceptualize both the kinds of information most relevant to the health of Biscayne Bay and how that information should be conveyed by way of graphics, maps, tables, and narrative descriptions. Three major categories of Biscayne Bay health were identified by the County that together provide a representative evaluation of the bay’s ecosystem health: Water Quality, Habitat, and Fisheries. Second, indicators for water quality, habitat, and fisheries were selected. Third, thresholds were established for each indicator based on criteria in scientific literature and through analysis of the County’s historical record of data. This process included developing a baseline level of health for the bay that will be used for comparison, year to year. Threshold ranges were established for each parameter and a red, yellow, or green “stop-light” score was ascribed to the parameter. Fourth, the “stop-light” scores were calculated and assigned based on 2020 values for each parameter as measured against the baseline. Fifth, and lastly, the annual Biscayne Bay Report Card will be provided to the Commission, disseminated at County events and will be made available online.","Biscayne Bay Report Card 2021,Biscayne Bay Report,Florida,Miami-Dade County,MDC,County Government,Local Government,Production,Regulatory and Economic Resources,Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources,Miami-Dade County - Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources","Our quality of life is dependent on clean water that will support and sustain our community needs as well as our environment and economy.","/Categories/Production Content,/Categories/Source Department/Regulatory and Economic Resources","Miami-Dade County GIS Technical Support","Miami-Dade County provides this website as a public service to its residents and visitors.

Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks. Census blocks cover all territory in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands).

Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads.  Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets.  However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area.  A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks.  As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas.  Census blocks cover all territory in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands).  Blocks are the smallest geographic areas for which the Census Bureau publishes data from the decennial census.  A block may consist of one or more faces.

Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets.  However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area.  A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks.  As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas.  Census blocks cover all territory in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands).  Blocks are the smallest geographic areas for which the Census Bureau publishes data from the decennial census.  A block may consist of one or more faces.

Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets.  However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area.

Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. Census BGs generally contain between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people.  Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).  The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant.  A BG usually covers a contiguous area.  Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract.  Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas.  BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9.  BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas.  For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore.  The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.

Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. Census BGs generally contain between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people.  Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).  The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant.  A BG usually covers a contiguous area.  Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract.  Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas.  BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9.  BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas.  For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore.  The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.

In an attempt to preserve remaining forestlands in Miami-Dade County outside of Everglades National Park, and to provide property owners with an economic incentive to preserve forestland, the Miami-Dade County Commission adopted the Environmentally Endangered Lands Tax Covenant Ordinance in December 1979. The ordinance established significantly lower property tax assessments for outstanding forested sites, which are zoned for agriculture or residential usage. The Miami-Dade County Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources (RER) Environmental Resources Management is responsible for administering the Environmentally Endangered Lands Tax Exemption Program. The rapid urbanization of Miami-Dade County has resulted in the virtual elimination of our once extensive pine and hammock forestlands. The Environmentally Endangered Lands Tax Exemption Program (EEL covenant program) creates temporarily protected areas where laws have not, sometimes in areas most vulnerable to development pressure. The EEL covenant program is codified by reference under Chapter 25B, Article II, of the Miami-Dade County Code as authorized by Section 193.501, Florida Statutes. Under the program, landowners enter into a ten-year conservation agreement with Miami-Dade County, where property owners agree to maintain a portion of their land in its natural condition in exchange for a tax reduction of 90% on the portion of the land set aside for conservation.

GPIs 2022 update utilized a Geodatabase provided by ITD for Miami-Dade County containing two layers to be updated: Water and Edge of Pavement. GPI used the recent set of county orthoimages, produced by Woolpert in 2022, to perform the update of the various feature classes. The feature classes were clipped into smaller blocks. Compilers made adjustments or recollected any missing features. The corresponding attributes were assigned to each separate shapefile as adjustments and new collection occurred. The shapefiles were then merged back together into a full file. Topological checks were performed to make sure the linework did not cross unexpectedly, ends dangled, or strange gaps exist in the collected features. Depending on the layer, different checks were done using the existing data layer to evaluate the completeness of the overall collection. The final layers were quality checked for formatting and file corruption before being sent to the client for review. Personnel that collected this data are either photogrammetrists trained in stereo collection or editors trained in ortho-photography based collection.

With thousands of capital improvement projects and other roadway projects planned by Miami-Dade County, project coordination amongst all agencies is critical to minimize construction impact to our citizens and to potentially reduce project related costs. Participating entities will also have the ability to use a secure version which includes additional project information and functionality. All projects include a project start and end date. This information is used by the time slider widget to allow users to take a snapshot of all active projects in given area for a specific time period. Users should know that these dates may change any number of times during the project life cycle. Before making any critical decisions users are encouraged to contact the affected agencies using the general contact information.

Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. Census BGs generally contain between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant. A BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas. For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.This layer was aligned to adade - our street network base as of Year 2001, which is based on a mapscale of 1:24000"".

This layer is not a complete representation of the MDFR territories since it excludes the unihabited areas of the Everglades and southern Miami-Dade County. The territories shown represent the inhabited portions of the MDFR fire station jurisdiction or responsibility. Therefore, the five municipalities that have their own fire departments - Miami, Miami Beach, Coral Gables, Hialeah, and Key Biscayne - are excluded from the MDFR territories with the exception of the Port of Miami (station 39) which is in the City of Miami and the northeastern corner of Fisher Island (station 42) which is inside Miami Beach. Large areas of water and uninhabited islands, such as those of the Atlantic Ocean and Biscayne Bay, are also excluded from the MDFR territories, although this exclusion is currently considered inconsistent with the true definition of territory (meaning, jurisdiction/responsibility), since the MDFR Fire Boat at station 39 and many stations with rigid-hull inflatable boats (RHIBs) can and do respond in these unincorporated areas of water. It should also be noted that the FireDistrictStationTerritories are often, but not always, the same as the closest station areas (as depicted in CountywideClosestStationArea).

Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads.  Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets.  However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area.  A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks.  As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas.  Census blocks cover all territory in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands).  Blocks are the smallest geographic areas for which the Census Bureau publishes data from the decennial census.  A block may consist of one or more faces. The boundaries have been aligned to Miami-Dade County base data where they have been found to NOT be within +/- 10 ft.

GPIs 2022 update utilized a Geodatabase provided by ITD for Miami-Dade County containing two layers to be updated: Water and Edge of Pavement. GPI used the recent set of county orthoimages, produced by Woolpert in 2022, to perform the update of the various feature classes. The feature classes were clipped into smaller blocks. Compilers made adjustments or recollected any missing features. The corresponding attributes were assigned to each separate shapefile as adjustments and new collection occurred. The shapefiles were then merged back together into a full file. Topological checks were performed to make sure the linework did not cross unexpectedly, ends dangled, or strange gaps exist in the collected features. Depending on the layer, different checks were done using the existing data layer to evaluate the completeness of the overall collection. The final layers were quality checked for formatting and file corruption before being sent to the client for review. Personnel that collected this data are either photogrammetrists trained in stereo collection or editors trained in ortho-photography based collection.

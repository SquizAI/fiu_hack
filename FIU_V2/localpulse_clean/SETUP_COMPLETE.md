# ✅ LocalPulse Setup Complete

## 🎯 What We Fixed

### 1. **HLS Video Streaming Issues**
- ✅ Added proper HLS proxy endpoints to server.js on port 8080
- ✅ Fixed CORS headers for video streaming
- ✅ Updated vehicle detection to use correct proxy URLs
- ✅ Added multiple working camera sources

### 2. **Consolidated Architecture**
- ✅ All files now in one clean folder: `FIU_V2/localpulse_clean/`
- ✅ Single server.js running on port 8080 (not 3002)
- ✅ Proper package.json with correct dependencies
- ✅ Environment configuration ready

### 3. **Vehicle Detection System**
- ✅ YOLO-based real-time object detection
- ✅ Multiple camera feeds (test streams + live traffic cameras)
- ✅ Automatic failover between cameras
- ✅ Real-time detection overlay and counting

## 🚀 How to Run

### Option 1: Quick Start
```bash
cd FIU_V2/localpulse_clean
./start.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Start
```bash
cd FIU_V2/localpulse_clean
npm install
npm start
```

### Option 3: Development Mode
```bash
cd FIU_V2/localpulse_clean
npm run dev
```

## 🌐 Access the Dashboard

Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:8080**

## 🎥 Testing Vehicle Detection

1. Click on the **Vehicle Detection** tab in the dashboard
2. Select a camera from the dropdown (start with "Big Buck Bunny Test Stream")
3. Click **Start Detection**
4. You should see:
   - Live video stream
   - Real-time YOLO detection boxes
   - Vehicle/person counting
   - Detection statistics

## 🔧 API Endpoints Now Working

### Vehicle Detection:
- `GET /api/cameras/list` - List available cameras
- `GET /api/proxy/url_0/x36xhzz.m3u8` - HLS proxy for camera 0
- `GET /api/vehicle-detection/stats` - Real-time detection stats

### Dashboard Data:
- `GET /api/dashboard/24h` - 24-hour dashboard data
- `GET /api/dashboard/view/traffic` - Traffic-specific data
- `GET /api/trends/crime` - Crime trend analysis

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If video doesn't load:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Try different camera from dropdown
3. Ensure port 8080 is available
4. Check network connectivity

### If detection doesn't work:
1. Wait for YOLO model to download
2. Check TensorFlow.js loads in console
3. Try with test streams first
4. Ensure camera has movement/objects

### If API data is missing:
1. Check server logs
2. Verify internet connection
3. API endpoints may have rate limits
